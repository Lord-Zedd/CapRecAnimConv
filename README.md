# CapRecAnimConv
Captured Recorded Animation Converter

A tool for converting captured H1 recorded animations, either directly or with some modifications.

Captures were created by reading the state of any objects actively controlled by an animation every tick. Their world position, bone data, and control data were also recorded alongside required information from the object tag itself. The hope is that only the conversion code would need to be added to in the future rather than re-capturing everything.

This should be a full collection of Halo 1's used recorded animations. Animations that did not seem to be called by any script and ones with no script references were left out.

The code to create new captures is not currently released.
